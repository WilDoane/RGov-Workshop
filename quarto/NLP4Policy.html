<p>Consider maintaining tags as separate data, so you can continue to grow the set of tags associated with your data over time.</p>

<section id="analyze" class="slide level2">
<h2>Analyze</h2>
<p>Converting textual data into frequency counts, co-occurrence matrices, similarity scores, topic models.</p>
<p>The goal is to reduce the number of documents that need to be considered and produce insights into patterns within and across the documents.</p>
<p>Existence flags, frequency counts, co-occurrences, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling are common methods.</p>
</section>
<section id="visualize" class="slide level2">
<h2>Visualize</h2>
<p>Visualizing the results of text analyses can range from trivial to challenging.</p>
<p>Tables of frequency counts are often the most direct way to convey top terms followed by bar charts of the same data, if needed. Word clouds are also popular</p>
<p>Visualizing the results of topic modeling is akin to spotting constellations in the night sky. You’re projecting 100,000+ dimensional spaces onto 2- or 3-dimensional surfaces.</p>

<h2>Formulate Policy Alternatives</h2>
<p>What topics you research and what constitutes evidence for or against policy alternatives varies greatly.</p>
<p>I often find myself considering a policy matrix:</p>

<h2>Communicate Findings</h2>
<p>Reproducible research involves collecting data, analyzing it, and communicating findings in ways that support review, reproduction, and (to your intended audience) transparency.</p>
<p>Tools such as <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">RMarkdown</a> and the newer and more capable <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> help you to structure your analyses as executable documents.</p>

<h2>There’s No Such This as “Plain Text”</h2>
<p>Data—including text—is represented in digital storage as a set of OFFs and ONs—ZEROs and ONEs.</p>
<p>How should those 0s and 1s be interpreted? Are they numbers? Letters? Sounds? Colors? Dates?</p>
<p><em>Character encodings</em> are conventions by which the 0s and 1s can be interpreted as text and other symbols.</p>

<p>It is allowed on all hands, that the primitive way of breaking eggs before we eat them, was upon the <em>larger end</em>: but his present Majesty’s grandfather, while he was a boy, going to eat an egg, and breaking it according to the ancient practice, happened to cut one of his fingers. Whereupon the Emperor his father published an edict, commanding all his subjects, upon great penalties, to break the <em>smaller end</em> of their eggs.</p>

<p>The backslash &nbsp;is used to <em>escape</em> the meaning of a character. For example, if you wanted to match a literal question mark how would yo do it? Remember: the question mark is used as a quantifier meaning <em>zero or one of the previous element</em>.</p>
<pre><code>\r     carriage return (ASCII 13)
\n     newline/line feed (ASCII 10)
\t     tab (ASCII 9)

The goal: identify problems and offer solutions and ideas for savings. In addition, the President asked each cabinet secretary to organize a 'Reinvention Team' to work from within each agency and to create 'Reinvention Laboratories' where experiments in new ways of doing business could begin immediately. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vice President and the National Performance Review teams sought input from people all across America. Vice President Gore spoke with workers at every major agency and at federal centers around the country. He visited programs that work and companies that have implemented new practices, dramatically changing their operations and decreasing costs while increasing profits in the process. The Vice President and the National Performance Review teams learned from the state and local leaders who have put many of these ideas into practice and they listened to the very best experts in the country -- from business, government, and the academic academy -- at special conferences in Philadelphia and Nashville. And, they listened to the American people whose letters and phone calls were invaluable. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Performance Review focused on how government should work, not on what it should do. The National Performance Review teams examined every cabinet department and 10 agencies. A 'bottom-up' review of the Department of Defense and the work of the Health Care and Welfare Reform Task Forces at the Department of Health and Human Services both covered areas that the National Health Review did not. \\r\\n\\r\\nSource: http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/npr/library/status/ex.sum.html\\r\\n\",\"id\":363,\"logo\":null,\"name\":\"National Partnership for Reinventing Government\",\"parent_id\":null,\"recent_articles_url\":\"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents?conditions%5Bagency_ids%5D%5B%5D=363&amp;order=newest\",\"short_name\":\"NPR\",\"slug\":\"national-partnership-for-reinventing-government\",\"url\":\"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-partnership-for-reinventing-government\",\"json_url\":\"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/363\"},{\"agency_url\":\"\",\"child_ids\":[],\"child_slugs\":[],\"description\":\"The National Prison Rape Elimination Commission (NPREC) was established in 2003 as a bipartisan commission under the authority of the Prison Rape Elimination Act.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commission was created to study Federal, State and local government policies and practices related to the prevention, detection, response and monitoring of sexual abuse in correction and detention facilities in the United States.

The new department, headed by Secretary Tom Ridge, brought a coordinated approach to national security from emergencies and disasters - both natural and man-made.\r\nOn October 4, 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act.

FAS agricultural counselors, attaches, trade officers, and locally employed FAS staff stationed in over 90 countries support U.S. agricultural interests and cover 140 countries.\r\n\r\nIn addition to agricultural affairs offices in U.S. embassies, agricultural trade offices also have been established in a number of key foreign markets and function as service centers for U.S. exporters and foreign buyers seeking market information.\r\n\r\nReports prepared by our overseas offices cover changes in policies and other developments that could affect U.S. agricultural exports. FAS staff in U.S. embassies around the world assess U.S. export marketing opportunities and respond to the daily informational needs of those who develop, initiate, monitor, and evaluate U.S. food and agricultural policies and programs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to data collection, FAS also maintains a worldwide agricultural reporting system based on information from U.S. agricultural traders, remote sensing systems, and other sources. Analysts in Washington, DC, prepare production forecasts, assess export marketing opportunities, and track changes in policies affecting U.S. agricultural exports and imports.\r\n\r\nFAS programs help U.S. exporters develop and maintain markets for hundreds of food and agricultural products, from bulk commodities to brand name items. Formal market promotion activities are carried out chiefly in cooperation with agricultural trade associations, State-regional trade groups, small businesses, and cooperatives that plan, manage, and contribute staff resources and funds to support these efforts. FAS also provides guidance to help exporters locate buyers and provides assistance through a variety of other methods. This includes supporting U.S. participation in several major trade shows and a number of single-industry exhibitions each year.","id":202,"logo":null,"name":"Foreign Agricultural Service","parent_id":12,"recent_articles_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents?conditions%5Bagency_ids%5D%5B%5D=202&amp;order=newest","short_name":"FAS","slug":"foreign-agricultural-service","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/foreign-agricultural-service","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/202"},{"agency_url":"http://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Office-of-Foreign-Assets-Control.aspx","child_ids":[],"child_slugs":[],"description":" The Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") of the US Department of the Treasury administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on US foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.

In addition, MSPB reviews the significant actions of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to assess the degree to which those actions may affect merit. \r\n","id":285,"logo":{"thumb_url":"https://agency-logos.federalregister.gov/285/thumb.jpg?1325105175","small_url":"https://agency-logos.federalregister.gov/285/small.jpg?1325105175","medium_url":"https://agency-logos.federalregister.gov/285/medium.jpg?1325105175"},"name":"Merit Systems Protection Board","parent_id":null,"recent_articles_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents?conditions%5Bagency_ids%5D%5B%5D=285&amp;order=newest","short_name":"MSPB","slug":"merit-systems-protection-board","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/merit-systems-protection-board","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/285"},{"agency_url":"http://www.mcrmc.gov/","child_ids":[],"child_slugs":[],"description":"The Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission was established by the National Defense Authorization Act FY 2013 Pub.

Originally intended as a six-month review of the federal government under the leadership of the Vice President Al Gore, NPR continued over several years and was eventually renamed the National Partnership on Reinventing Government in early 1998.\r\n\r\nUnder Vice President Gore, the NPR gathered experienced federal workers and organized them into teams to examine federal agencies and issues that cut across agencies, such as personnel, procurement or budget policies. The goal: identify problems and offer solutions and ideas for savings. In addition, the President asked each cabinet secretary to organize a 'Reinvention Team' to work from within each agency and to create 'Reinvention Laboratories' where experiments in new ways of doing business could begin immediately. \r\n\r\nThe Vice President and the National Performance Review teams sought input from people all across America. Vice President Gore spoke with workers at every major agency and at federal centers around the country. He visited programs that work and companies that have implemented new practices, dramatically changing their operations and decreasing costs while increasing profits in the process. The Vice President and the National Performance Review teams learned from the state and local leaders who have put many of these ideas into practice and they listened to the very best experts in the country -- from business, government, and the academic academy -- at special conferences in Philadelphia and Nashville. And, they listened to the American people whose letters and phone calls were invaluable. \r\n\r\nThe National Performance Review focused on how government should work, not on what it should do. The National Performance Review teams examined every cabinet department and 10 agencies. A 'bottom-up' review of the Department of Defense and the work of the Health Care and Welfare Reform Task Forces at the Department of Health and Human Services both covered areas that the National Health Review did not. \r\n\r\nSource: http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/npr/library/status/ex.sum.html\r\n","id":363,"logo":null,"name":"National Partnership for Reinventing Government","parent_id":null,"recent_articles_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/documents?conditions%5Bagency_ids%5D%5B%5D=363&amp;order=newest","short_name":"NPR","slug":"national-partnership-for-reinventing-government","url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-partnership-for-reinventing-government","json_url":"https://www.federalregister.gov/api/v1/agencies/363"},{"agency_url":"","child_ids":[],"child_slugs":[],"description":"The National Prison Rape Elimination Commission (NPREC) was established in 2003 as a bipartisan commission under the authority of the Prison Rape Elimination Act.\r\n\r\nThe Commission was created to study Federal, State and local government policies and practices related to the prevention, detection, response and monitoring of sexual abuse in correction and detention facilities in the United States.

        "description": "The Corps story began more than 200 years ago when Congress established the Continental Army with a provision for a chief engineer on June 16, 1775. The Army established the Corps of Engineers as a separate, permanent branch on March 16, 1802, and gave the engineers responsibility for founding and operating the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. \r\n\r\nSince then, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has responded to changing defense requirements and played an integral part in the development of the country. Throughout the 19th century, the Corps built coastal fortifications, surveyed roads and canals, eliminated navigational hazards, explored and mapped the Western frontier, and constructed buildings and monuments in the Nation's capital. While the mission and tasks have evolved with the needs and priorities of the Nation, the dedication and commitment of the workforce has remained constant.\r\n\r\nToday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has approximately 34,000 dedicated Civilians and Soldiers delivering engineering services to customers in more than 90 countries worldwide. With environmental sustainability as a guiding principle, our disciplined Corps team is working diligently to strengthen our Nation's security by building and maintaining America's infrastructure and providing military facilities where our servicemembers train, work and live. We are also researching and developing technology for our war fighters while protecting America's interests abroad by using our engineering expertise to promote stability and improve quality of life. We are energizing the economy by dredging America's waterways to support the movement of critical commodities and providing recreation opportunities at our campgrounds, lakes and marinas. And by devising hurricane and storm damage reduction infrastructure, we are reducing risks from disasters. [http://www.usace.army.mil/]",

FEMA can trace its beginnings to the Congressional Act of 1803. This act, generally considered the first piece of disaster legislation, provided assistance to a New Hampshire town following an extensive fire. In the century that followed, ad hoc legislation was passed more than 100 times in response to hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters.\r\nIn 2001, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11th focused the agency on issues of national preparedness and homeland security, and tested the agency in unprecedented ways. The agency coordinated its activities with the newly formed Office of Homeland Security, and FEMA's Office of National Preparedness was given responsibility for helping to ensure that the nation's first responders were trained and equipped to deal with weapons of mass destruction.\r\nIn March 2003, FEMA joined 22 other federal agencies, programs and offices in becoming the Department of Homeland Security. The new department, headed by Secretary Tom Ridge, brought a coordinated approach to national security from emergencies and disasters - both natural and man-made.\r\nOn October 4, 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Post-Katrina Emergency Reform Act. The act significantly reorganized FEMA, provided it substantial new authority to remedy gaps that became apparent in the response to Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, the most devastating natural disaster in U.S. history, and included a more robust preparedness mission for FEMA. \r\n",

        "description": "The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) was created on July 30, 2008, when the President signed into law the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The Act created a world-class, empowered regulator with all of the authorities necessary to oversee vital components of our country's secondary mortgage markets - Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. In addition, this law combined the staffs of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB), and the GSE mission office at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). With a very turbulent market facing our nation, the strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory oversight of the 14 housing-related GSEs is imperative. The establishment of FHFA will promote a stronger, safer U.S. housing finance system. As of June 2008, the combined debt and obligations of these GSEs totaled $6.6 trillion, exceeding the total publicly held debt of the USA by $1.3 trillion. The GSEs also purchased or guaranteed 84% of new mortgages. Considering the impact of these GSEs on the U.S. economy and mortgage market, it is critical that we intensify our focus on oversight of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. \r\n\r\n\r\nFHFA is comprised of combined staffs of the former Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the former Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB), and the GSE mission office at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

The twelve regional FHLBs are privately-held government sponsored enterprises that ensure the supply of funds to local lenders that, in turn, finance loans for home mortgages. The FHLBs are located in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Des Moines, Indianapolis, New York, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Seattle, and Topeka.

        "description": "The International Development Cooperation Agency (IDCA) was established by Executive Order in September, 1979.\r\n\r\nAs an attempt to reorganize the foreign assistance management structure, the IDCA was envisioned by Senator Hubert Humphrey in 1978,  to coordinate foreign assistance activities as they related to bilateral programs administered by USAID, multilateral programs of international lending institutions then under the purview of the Department of the Treasury, voluntary contributions to United Nations agencies then administered by the Department of State, food programs then administered by USAID, and the activities of OPIC. An International Development Institute would be established within IDCA to address, among other things, private and voluntary organizations and with one of the Institute's constituent parts being the Peace Corps. \r\n\r\nAs established under Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1979, the only entity it actually coordinated was USAID and, since it was staffed with fewer than 75 people, could make only a marginal impact on overall bilateral and multilateral assistance policy. In the Reagan Administration, no staff were provided to IDCA and, functionally, it faded quickly from the scene. The Executive Order creating IDCA remained intact, however, defining some of the lines of authority in the administration of foreign assistance. Some of the other coordinating functions that had been expected to be exercised by IDCA (but not contained in the Executive Order) were initially exercised instead by USAID, but over time the functions fell into disuse. \r\n\r\nThe IDCA was abolished by act of Oct. 2, 1998 (112 Stat. 2681-790) and its functions transferred to the Department of State, U.S. Agency for International Development, and overseas Private Investment Corporation.\r\n\r\n__________\r\nSources:\r\nU.S. Government Manual, (2009/2010 ed.), p. 612.\r\nhttp://www.usaid.gov/about_usaid/usaidhist.html",

Its enforcement powers to set rates were also progressively extended, through statute and broadened Supreme Court interpretations of the commerce clause of the Constitution, as were its investigative powers for determining fair rates of return on which to base rates. In addition, the ICC was given the task of consolidating railroad systems and managing labor disputes in interstate transport. In the 1950s and 60s the ICC enforced U.S. Supreme Court rulings that required the desegregation of passenger terminal facilities.\r\n\r\nThe ICC's safety functions were transferred to the Department of Transportation in 1966. The ICC retained its rate-making and regulatory functions. However, in consonance with the deregulatory movement, the ICC's powers over rates and routes in rails and trucking were curtailed in 1980 by the Staggers Rail Act and Motor Carriers Act. Most ICC control over interstate trucking was abandoned in 1994, and the agency was terminated at the end of 1995. Many of its remaining functions were transferred to the new National Surface Transportation Board.",

Section 331 of title 28 specifically provides that the Judicial Conference shall: \r\n\r\n(1) Make a comprehensive survey of the conditions of business in the courts of the United States; \r\n(2) Prepare plans for the assignment of judges to or from courts of appeals or district courts, where necessary; \r\n(3) Submit suggestions to the various courts in the interest of promoting uniformity of management procedures and the expeditious conduct of court business; \r\n(4) Exercise authority provided in chapter 16 of title 28 United States Codes for the review of circuit council conduct and disability orders filed under that chapter; and \r\n(5) Carry on a continuous study of the operation and effect of the general rules of practice and procedure in use within the federal courts, as prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to law. \r\n\r\nThe Judicial Conference also supervises the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts in the performance of his duties as the administrative officer of the courts of the United States under 28 U.S.C.

LMRDA was enacted by Congress to ensure certain basic standards of democracy and fiscal responsibility in labor organizations representing employees in private industry. The organization's original name was the Bureau of Labor-Management Reports (BLMR). It was re-named the Labor-Management Services Administration (LMSA) in 1963.\r\n\r\nAt one time or another LMSA had responsibilities which included pension and welfare plans, Federal labor relations, veterans reemployment rights, and an anti-racketeering/organized crime strike force. Through reorganizations and the creation of new agencies through legislation, these functions were subsequently transferred to other Federal agencies.\r\n\r\nWith the passage of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) in 1978, the federal labor relations program was transferred to the newly created Federal Labor Relations Authority. However, the Standard of Conduct provisions of the CSRA which regulate internal affairs of federal-sector unions remained in LMSA. In 1980, the Foreign Service Act (FSA) was passed and unions representing employees of the Department of State and U.S. Information Agency (USIA) became subject to Standards of Conduct requirements.\r\n\r\nThe agency became known as OLMS in 1984. In 1992, OLMS became part of the Employment Standards Administration (ESA). In 1993, OLMS was transferred to the newly created Office of the American Workplace (OAW). In 1996, OAW ceased to exist and OLMS was transferred back to ESA. In 2009, ESA was eliminated and OLMS became an independent agency reporting directly to the Secretary of Labor.\r\n",

The Commission consists of three U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officers, one member of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (formerly the Coast and Geodetic Survey), and three civilians, two of whom must be civil engineers. Each member of the MRC is nominated by the United States President and confirmed by the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe general duties of the MRC include the recommendation of policy and work on flood control, navigation, and environmental projects affecting the Mississippi River; the study of and reporting on the necessity for modifications to river operations, and conducting semiannual inspection trips and public hearings at various locations along the river. The intent behind the mission of the MRC today is to lead sustainable management and development of water related resources for the nation’s benefit and the people’s well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n__________\r\nSource:\r\nhttp://www.mvd.usace.army.mil/mrc/about/index.php\r\n",

        "description": "The National Partnership for Reinventing Government was originally designated the National Performance Review (NPR) as an interagency task force on March 3, 1993. Originally intended as a six-month review of the federal government under the leadership of the Vice President Al Gore, NPR continued over several years and was eventually renamed the National Partnership on Reinventing Government in early 1998.\r\n\r\nUnder Vice President Gore, the NPR gathered experienced federal workers and organized them into teams to examine federal agencies and issues that cut across agencies, such as personnel, procurement or budget policies. The goal: identify problems and offer solutions and ideas for savings. In addition, the President asked each cabinet secretary to organize a 'Reinvention Team' to work from within each agency and to create 'Reinvention Laboratories' where experiments in new ways of doing business could begin immediately. \r\n\r\nThe Vice President and the National Performance Review teams sought input from people all across America. Vice President Gore spoke with workers at every major agency and at federal centers around the country. He visited programs that work and companies that have implemented new practices, dramatically changing their operations and decreasing costs while increasing profits in the process. The Vice President and the National Performance Review teams learned from the state and local leaders who have put many of these ideas into practice and they listened to the very best experts in the country -- from business, government, and the academic academy -- at special conferences in Philadelphia and Nashville. And, they listened to the American people whose letters and phone calls were invaluable. \r\n\r\nThe National Performance Review focused on how government should work, not on what it should do. The National Performance Review teams examined every cabinet department and 10 agencies. A 'bottom-up' review of the Department of Defense and the work of the Health Care and Welfare Reform Task Forces at the Department of Health and Human Services both covered areas that the National Health Review did not. \r\n\r\nSource: http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/npr/library/status/ex.sum.html\r\n",

Of this route system, Amtrak owns about 530 route miles in the Northeast and several other small track segments elsewhere in the country.\r\rAmtrak owns or leases its stations and owns its own repair and maintenance facilities. The Corporation employs a total workforce of approximately 19,000 and provides all reservation, station, and on-board service staffs, as well as train and engine operating crews. Outside the Northeast Corridor, Amtrak contracts with privately or publicly owned railroads for the right to operate over their track. Under contract, these railroads are responsible for the condition of the roadbed and for coordinating the flow of traffic.\r\rIn fiscal year 2008, Amtrak transported over 28 million people with 78,000 passengers traveling on Amtrak per day. Also, Amtrak runs commuter trains under contract with several commuter agencies.\r\rAlthough Amtrak's basic route system was originally designated by the Secretary of Transportation in 1971, modifications have been made to the Amtrak system and to individual routes that have resulted in more efficient and cost-effective operations. Although capital funding has increased in recent years, operating budget constraints mean that new service will only be added if a State agrees to cover any operating losses.",

OPIC offers up to $250 million in long-term financing and/or political risk insurance to U.S. companies investing in over 150 emerging markets and developing countries. Backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, OPIC advocates for U.S. investment, offers experience in risk management, and draws on an outstanding record of success.\r\rOPIC mobilizes America's private sector to advance U.S. foreign policy and development initiatives.

BTS brings a greater degree of coordination, comparability, and quality standards to transportation data, and facilitates in the closing of important data gaps.\r\rOn February 20, 2005, BTS became a part of the Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA). RITA is composed of BTS, the former Research Office of the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (formerly with RSPA), Transportation Safety Institute (formerly with RSPA), and Office of Intermodalism (formerly with the Office of the Secretary). BTS is headed by a Director, appointed by the Secretary of Transportation, and the Director reports to the RITA Administrator.\r\rBTS' basic authorizing legislation is the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), which authorizes $27 million each year for a five year period (2005-2009). This funding comes from the Highway Trust Fund, and is administered within the Research and Development account under the Federal Highway Administration. \r\rBTS' data collection program for aviation is authorized under separate legislation enacted when the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) was terminated. This program is a mandatory data collection. The Wendell Ford Aviation Investment Reform Act (AIR-21) authorized funding for the airline information program from the Airport and Airways Trust Fund (AATF), but to date no funding has been appropriated.

        "description": "The establishment of the Veterans Administration (VA) came in 1930 when Congress authorized the President to \"consolidate and coordinate Government activities affecting war veterans.\" The three component agencies (the Veterans Bureau, the Bureau of Pensions of the Interior Department, and the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers) became bureaus within the Veterans Administration.  \r\n\r\nThe VA is responsible for administering benefit programs for veterans, their families, and their survivors. These benefits include pension, education, disability compensation, home loans, life insurance, vocational rehabilitation, survivor support, medical care, and burial benefits. \r\n\r\nOf the 25 million veterans currently alive, nearly three of every four served during a war or an official period of hostility. About a quarter of the nation's population — approximately 70 million people — are potentially eligible for V.A. benefits and services because they are veterans, family members, or survivors of veterans. \r\n\r\nFor further information about the functions, organization, and activities, of the Veterans Administration, please visit http://www.va.gov/.\r\n\r\n__________\r\nSources:\r\nhttp://www4.va.gov/about_va/vahistory.asp\r\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/our-government/executive-branch",

Policy. Too many Americans face challenges \n                paying for prescription drugs. On average, Americans \n                pay two to three times as much as people in other \n                countries for prescription drugs, and one in four \n                Americans who take prescription drugs struggle to \n                afford their medications. Nearly 3 in 10 American \n                adults who take prescription drugs say that they have \n                skipped doses, cut pills in half, or not filled \n                prescriptions due to cost.\n\n                On July 9, 2021, I signed Executive Order 14036 \n                (Promoting Competition in the American Economy), which \n                directed various actions in pursuit of my \n                Administration's policy to improve competition, \n                increase wages, and reduce prices for prescription \n                drugs, among other goods and services. In response to \n                Executive Order 14036, the Department of Health and \n                Human Services (HHS) submitted a report to the White \n                House Competition Council calling for bold legislative \n                and administrative actions to lower drug prices.\n\n                On August 16, 2022, I signed Public Law 117-169, \n                commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act of \n                2022 (IRA), which will lower the cost of prescription \n                drugs and save millions of Americans hundreds or \n                thousands of dollars per year. The IRA will protect \n                Medicare beneficiaries from catastrophic drug costs by \n                phasing in a cap for out-of-pocket costs at the \n                pharmacy and establishing a $35 monthly cap per \n                prescription for insulin covered by a Medicare \n                prescription drug plan and insulin delivered through \n                traditional pumps. Starting this January, Medicare \n                beneficiaries with prescription drug coverage will pay \n                $0 out of pocket for recommended adult vaccines \n                (including the shingles vaccine). The IRA will also \n                require certain companies to pay Medicare rebates if \n                they increase the prices of drugs used by Medicare \n                beneficiaries faster than the rate of inflation. In \n                addition, the Secretary of HHS (Secretary) will be able \n                to negotiate prices for selected high-cost prescription \n                drugs for Medicare beneficiaries for the first time \n                ever. Following the passage of the IRA, HHS has taken \n                critical steps to swiftly implement these historic \n                provisions in order to deliver results and lower health \n                care costs for the American people.\n\n                As my Administration works to implement the IRA, it is \n                critical that we take additional actions to complement \n                the IRA and further drive down prescription drug costs. \n                Within HHS, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid \n                Innovation (``Innovation Center'') tests health care \n                payment and delivery models to improve health care \n                quality and make the delivery of health care more \n                efficient. In June 2022, the Innovation Center \n                announced a new model to improve cancer care and lower \n                health care costs for cancer patients, including \n                prescription drug costs. The Innovation Center provides \n                my Administration and the American people with a useful \n                set of tools to help lower health care costs and \n                improve quality of care, and its work can advance the \n                continued policy of my Administration to lower the cost \n                of prescription drugs.\n\n                Sec. 2. HHS Actions. In furtherance of the policy set \n                forth in section 1 of this order, the Secretary shall, \n                consistent with the criteria set out in 42 U.S.C. \n                1315a(b)(2), consider whether to select for testing by \n                the Innovation Center new health care payment and \n                delivery models that would lower\n\n[[Page 63400]]\n\n                drug costs and promote access to innovative drug \n                therapies for beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare \n                and Medicaid programs, including models that may lead \n                to lower cost-sharing for commonly used drugs and \n                support value-based payment that promotes high-quality \n                care. The Secretary shall, not later than 90 days after \n                the date of this order, submit a report to the \n                Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy \n                enumerating and describing any models that the \n                Secretary has selected. The report shall also include \n                the Secretary's plan and timeline to test any such \n                models. Following the submission of the report, the \n                Secretary shall take appropriate actions to test any \n                health care payment and delivery models discussed in \n                the report.\n\n                Sec. 3.

                Executive Order 14087 of October 14, 2022

                
Lowering Prescription Drug Costs for Americans

                By the authority vested in me as President by the 
                Constitution and the laws of the United States of 
                America, it is hereby ordered as follows:

                Section 1. Policy. Too many Americans face challenges 
                paying for prescription drugs. On average, Americans 
                pay two to three times as much as people in other 
                countries for prescription drugs, and one in four 
                Americans who take prescription drugs struggle to 
                afford their medications. Nearly 3 in 10 American 
                adults who take prescription drugs say that they have 
                skipped doses, cut pills in half, or not filled 
                prescriptions due to cost.

                On July 9, 2021, I signed Executive Order 14036 
                (Promoting Competition in the American Economy), which 
                directed various actions in pursuit of my 
                Administration's policy to improve competition, 
                increase wages, and reduce prices for prescription 
                drugs, among other goods and services. In response to 
                Executive Order 14036, the Department of Health and 
                Human Services (HHS) submitted a report to the White 
                House Competition Council calling for bold legislative 
                and administrative actions to lower drug prices.

                On August 16, 2022, I signed Public Law 117-169, 
                commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act of 
                2022 (IRA), which will lower the cost of prescription 
                drugs and save millions of Americans hundreds or 
                thousands of dollars per year. The IRA will protect 
                Medicare beneficiaries from catastrophic drug costs by 
                phasing in a cap for out-of-pocket costs at the 
                pharmacy and establishing a $35 monthly cap per 
                prescription for insulin covered by a Medicare 
                prescription drug plan and insulin delivered through 
                traditional pumps. Starting this January, Medicare 
                beneficiaries with prescription drug coverage will pay 
                $0 out of pocket for recommended adult vaccines 
                (including the shingles vaccine). The IRA will also 
                require certain companies to pay Medicare rebates if 
                they increase the prices of drugs used by Medicare 
                beneficiaries faster than the rate of inflation. In 
                addition, the Secretary of HHS (Secretary) will be able 
                to negotiate prices for selected high-cost prescription 
                drugs for Medicare beneficiaries for the first time 
                ever. Following the passage of the IRA, HHS has taken 
                critical steps to swiftly implement these historic 
                provisions in order to deliver results and lower health 
                care costs for the American people.

                As my Administration works to implement the IRA, it is 
                critical that we take additional actions to complement 
                the IRA and further drive down prescription drug costs. 
                Within HHS, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid 
                Innovation (``Innovation Center'') tests health care 
                payment and delivery models to improve health care 
                quality and make the delivery of health care more 
                efficient. In June 2022, the Innovation Center 
                announced a new model to improve cancer care and lower 
                health care costs for cancer patients, including 
                prescription drug costs. The Innovation Center provides 
                my Administration and the American people with a useful 
                set of tools to help lower health care costs and 
                improve quality of care, and its work can advance the 
                continued policy of my Administration to lower the cost 
                of prescription drugs.

                Sec. 2. HHS Actions. In furtherance of the policy set 
                forth in section 1 of this order, the Secretary shall, 
                consistent with the criteria set out in 42 U.S.C. 
                1315a(b)(2), consider whether to select for testing by 
                the Innovation Center new health care payment and 
                delivery models that would lower

[[Page 63400]]

                drug costs and promote access to innovative drug 
                therapies for beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare 
                and Medicaid programs, including models that may lead 
                to lower cost-sharing for commonly used drugs and 
                support value-based payment that promotes high-quality 
                care. The Secretary shall, not later than 90 days after 
                the date of this order, submit a report to the 
                Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy 
                enumerating and describing any models that the 
                Secretary has selected. The report shall also include 
                the Secretary's plan and timeline to test any such 
                models. Following the submission of the report, the 
                Secretary shall take appropriate actions to test any 
                health care payment and delivery models discussed in 
                the report.

                Sec. 3. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order 
                shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or 
the head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

                    (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with 
                applicable law and subject to the availability of 
                appropriations.
                    (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, 
                create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, 
                enforceable at law or in equity by any party against 
                the United States, its departments, agencies, or 
                entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any 
                other person.
                
                
                    (Presidential Sig.)

                THE WHITE HOUSE,

                    October 14, 2022.

<p>TM builds on <em>term-frequency</em> or <em>TF</em> data of the type we’ve been creating: frequency counts of the number of times each term appears in a document or across documents.</p>
<p>TF is the relative frequency of a term within a document. That is, for any given term, the frequency of the term divided by the number of terms in the document.</p>
</div>
<div id="tabset-14-2">
<p>To this, we add the notion of <em>inverse document frequency</em> or <em>IDF</em>. IDF decreases the weight of terms that occur frequently in a corpus and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely. For example, “of” is a common term and doesn’t carry much information. We probably shouldn’t pay much attention to such common terms.</p>
<p>IDF is a measure of whether a term is common or rare in a given corpus.</p>
</div>
<div id="tabset-14-3">
<p>The term-frequency times the inverse document frequency.</p>
<p>Plainly: the number of times a given term occurs in a document times the log ratio of the number of documents to the number of documents in which the term appears.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/inverse-document-frequency" class="uri">https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/inverse-document-frequency</a></p>

<div id="tabset-14-4">
<ul>
<li>Every document is a mixture of topics.</li>
<li>Every topic is a mixture of terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Latent Dirichlet allocation is a method for “finding the mixture of words that is associated with each topic, while also determining the mixture of topics that describes each document.” <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/topicmodeling.html">Text Mining with R</a></p>
<p>This approach sometimes referred to as the <em>bag of words</em> model.</p>

<h1>Communicate Findings</h1>
<p>Communicating your findings in a reproducible way is important. You will need to run, re-run, and re-re-run your analyses. Perhaps the data has changed or your methods or your analytical approach.</p>
<p>This entire presentation—including code and the executed results—was created using <a href="https://quarto.org">Quarto</a>, which is included with the latest RStudio releases.</p>
</section>

<section id="communicate-findings-2" class="title-slide slide level1 center">
<h1>Communicate Findings</h1>
<ul>
<li>Create an RStudio project for each analysis effort</li>
<li>Create a <code>README.md</code> file to document the purpose and history of your project</li>
<li>Keep a read-only version of your source data in <code>data-raw</code></li>
<li>Keep modified and extracted data in <code>data</code></li>
<li>Keep scripts in <code>R</code></li>
<li>Keep Quarto documents in <code>quarto</code></li>
<li>Keep generated graphics, MS Word and Excel documents, etc. in <code>output</code></li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="communicate-findings-3" class="title-slide slide level1 center">
<h1>Communicate Findings</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use scales::label_* to format numeric values (%, $, etc.) when needed</li>
<li>Use english::english() to convert numeric values to text when needed</li>
<li>Use ggplot2::theme_bw() to create a standard, minimal look &amp; feel</li>
<li>Use ggplot2::ggsave() to generate images at high resolution and the intended dimensions</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="communicate-findings-4" class="title-slide slide level1 center">
<h1>Communicate Findings</h1>
<ul>
<li>Develop a habit of restarting your R session often
<ul>
<li>Your analyses should be able to run from beginning to end in a clean environment</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consider using version control software, such as GIT</li>
<li>When working with text in the R Console, clear the console often
<ul>
<li>Large text output to the console may slow down your computer</li>
